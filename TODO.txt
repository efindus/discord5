P1:
ratelimits
ipbans after consistently hitting the rate limit
username allowlist

P2 QoL:
fix tooltips (make a tooltip layer and make some wacky JS to show a popup at the right position (preferably within the screen bounds))
var rect = elem.getBoundingClientRect();
var win = elem.ownerDocument.defaultView;

return {
    top: rect.top + win.pageYOffset,
    left: rect.left + win.pageXOffset
};

change sidebar color to not be identical to message hover
change attachment color to be defined as css property
fix code snippets (remake into grids preferably instead of glueing them together with ductape AGAIN)
animate hiding the spinner (transition-property: opacity, visibility; transition-delay: 0s, animation length)

P3:
hostname resolution
attachment upload/download quota

P4 QoL:
maybe make the spinner animation cooler
attachment upload progress bar
add admins (admin panel) (and user bans)

Far Future QoL:
add replies
add mentions <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4705848/rendering-html-inside-textarea>
