mobile notifications when not open

P2:
load messages in 151 message sections (1 message and 75 above and below) [ goals:

 - ability to use bloated templates (or even custom elements) (so features like message meta are toggled by css classes instead of conditional template literals) to cleanup code
 - justification for a scroll-to-bottom button/bar
 - allow for restoring scroll-height after app closure/disconnect
 - feature base to facilitate search/jumping to the original message (of a reply)
